# DBL Functional tissue repair

In this project-based learning (PBL), we have worked on the development of an artificial fiber-reinforced material to replace damaged tissue.
In the body, various organs such as the heart and lungs are enclosed by a serous membrane. During surgery on the underlying organs, these membranes must be opened and closed,
which can lead to scar tissue and adhesions, causing the tissue to no longer function properly. As a treatment, (fiber-reinforced) synthetic material can then be applied as a patch.
